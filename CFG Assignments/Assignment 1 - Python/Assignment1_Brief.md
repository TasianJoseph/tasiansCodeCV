"Create a program that can retrieve multiple Pokémons and save only their names and moves only to a file in a nice,
readable format. At first, we want to ask the user what Pokémons to get and have a choice to get a random one.
We want to check they have picked Pikachu as one of the Pokémons. The program should guide users to pick the best
Pokémons and have nice messages as we run our program."
