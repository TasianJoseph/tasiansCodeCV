# Assignment 2: API console app

## For this assignment:
I have decided to create a console app which uses the Harry Potter Characters API.
I used the following packages:
* requests - to parse and access the json data.
* random - to add some functionality to the script and enable randomisation using random.sample() to access the names
from the listed character dictionaries.

### The scenario and use case I thought of:

**Who are you?** 

You are a creative and thoughtful primary school teacher who puts on a themed games every Friday! 

**What are you using my app for?** 

This Friday, you're planning a Harry Potter character themed Bingo game and are using the selector to create Bingo cards
for your students.

**Why are you using my app?** 

It allows you to choose questions at random from the API and the selection is saved to a *txt* file at the end, which 
you can easily use to create your Bingo game.

Just FYI I make a lot of comments as I go, sorry if its annoying!
